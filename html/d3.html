                    billion years
                    ago. As a result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all <br /> matter were created, leading to the

                <p>Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions <br /> where gravity is
                    so
                    intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black <br />holes interact with nearby matter and
                    can
                    emit radiation.</p>

                <p>
                    String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the physical world. According to
                    this theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain additional
                    microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces with
                    different sizes and characteristics.

                    Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a single framework that <br />
                    explains
                    all fundamental forces and particles in the universe, including gravity, <br /> electromagnetism,

                    with each vibration corresponding to a different particle type.</p>
